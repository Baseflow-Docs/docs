# Colors and Themes

Baseflow supports light and dark modes out of the box. You can customize the primary accent color to match your brand, and readers can toggle between themes.

## Theme Colors

Set your brand colors in `docs.json`:

```json docs.json
{
  "colors": {
    "primary": "#6366F1",
    "light": "#818CF8",
    "dark": "#4F46E5"
  }
}
```

| Field     | Description                                                      |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `primary` | Main accent color — used for links, buttons, and active states.  |
| `light`   | Lighter variant used in light mode for hover states and accents. |
| `dark`    | Darker variant used in dark mode for the same elements.          |

## Light and Dark Mode

Baseflow includes both light and dark themes by default. Readers can switch between them using the theme toggle in the header.

- **Light mode**: Clean white background with dark text
- **Dark mode**: Dark background with light text, using your `dark` color variant for accents

The theme toggle respects the reader's system preference by default, and remembers their manual choice.

## Choosing Good Colors

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Contrast matters">
    Make sure your primary color has enough contrast against both light and dark
    backgrounds. Test links and buttons in both themes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stay on-brand">
    Use your product's primary brand color. Documentation should feel like part
    of your product, not a separate site.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Avoid pure colors">
    Pure red (#FF0000) or pure blue (#0000FF) can feel harsh. Slightly muted
    tones like #EF4444 or #3B82F6 look better in documentation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test with real content">
    Preview your color choices with actual documentation content, not just the
    empty template. Code blocks, callouts, and cards all use the accent color.

## Color Examples

Here are some popular color combinations:

| Brand Style | Primary   | Light     | Dark      |
| ----------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Indigo      | `#6366F1` | `#818CF8` | `#4F46E5` |
| Blue        | `#3B82F6` | `#60A5FA` | `#2563EB` |
| Emerald     | `#10B981` | `#34D399` | `#059669` |
| Orange      | `#F97316` | `#FB923C` | `#EA580C` |
| Rose        | `#F43F5E` | `#FB7185` | `#E11D48` |
| Violet      | `#8B5CF6` | `#A78BFA` | `#7C3AED` |

<Callout type="tip">
  When in doubt, start with your product's primary button color. That's usually
  the best choice for your documentation's accent color too.
