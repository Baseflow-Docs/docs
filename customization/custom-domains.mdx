# Custom Domains

By default, your docs are served at `your-slug.baseflow.dev`. With a custom domain, you can host documentation on your own subdomain like `docs.yourcompany.com`.

<Callout type="info">
  Custom domains are available on the **Pro plan** and above.
</Callout>

## Setup Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Project Settings">
    Go to your project in the Baseflow dashboard and navigate to **Settings → Domains**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Your Domain">
    Enter the domain you want to use, such as `docs.yourcompany.com`. Click **Add Domain**.

    </Frame>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure DNS">
    Add a CNAME record with your DNS provider pointing your domain to Baseflow:

    | Type    | Name   | Value                     |
    | ------- | ------ | ------------------------- |
    | `CNAME` | `docs` | `cname.baseflow.dev`      |

    <Callout type="warning">
      DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate, though most complete within minutes.
    </Callout>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify and Go Live">
    Once DNS propagates, Baseflow automatically verifies the domain and provisions an SSL certificate. Your docs will be accessible at your custom domain with HTTPS.

    <Frame caption="Domain verified and active">
      Screenshot needed: The domain settings panel showing a green "Active" badge next to the custom domain with SSL status confirmed.
    </Frame>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## SSL Certificates

Baseflow automatically provisions and renews SSL certificates for custom domains via Let's Encrypt. No manual configuration needed — HTTPS works out of the box.

## Subdomain vs. Root Domain

| Configuration           | DNS Record | Example                |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| Subdomain (recommended) | `CNAME`    | `docs.yourcompany.com` |
| Root domain             | `A` record | `yourcompany.com`      |

<Callout type="tip">
  We recommend using a subdomain like `docs.yourcompany.com`. This is simpler to
  configure and doesn't interfere with your main website.
</Callout>

## Multiple Domains

If you need the same docs at multiple domains (e.g., during a migration), you can add more than one custom domain to a project. Both will serve the same content.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain shows 'Pending' for a long time">
    DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours. Verify your CNAME record is
    correctly set using a tool like [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org).
    Make sure the CNAME target is `cname.baseflow.dev` (not your Baseflow
    subdomain).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="SSL certificate not provisioning">
    SSL certificates are issued automatically once DNS is verified. If it's
    stuck, check that there are no conflicting DNS records (like an A record on
    the same subdomain) and that your DNS provider isn't proxying the request
    (e.g., Cloudflare orange cloud — set it to DNS-only / grey cloud during
    setup).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Domain works but shows wrong content">
    Make sure the domain is connected to the correct project in the Baseflow
    dashboard. If you have multiple projects, verify you're editing the right
    one.
  </Accordion>
