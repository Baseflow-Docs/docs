# SEO

Baseflow handles many SEO best practices automatically, but you can fine-tune how your pages appear in search results with frontmatter and configuration.

## Automatic SEO

Baseflow generates the following for every page without any configuration:

- **Title tag** from the page's `title` frontmatter
- **Meta description** from the page's `description` frontmatter
- **Open Graph tags** for social sharing (title, description, site name)
- **Canonical URL** based on the page's path
- **Semantic HTML** with proper heading hierarchy
- **Clean URLs** without file extensions (e.g., `/guides/quickstart` not `/guides/quickstart.mdx`)

## Page-Level SEO

The most important thing you can do for SEO is write good frontmatter on every page:

```yaml

```

### Title Best Practices

| Practice                 | Example                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Be specific              | "API Authentication Guide" ✓                  |
| Avoid generic titles     | "Guide" ✗                                     |
| Include primary keyword  | "Deploy to Production with Docker" ✓          |
| Keep under 60 characters | Longer titles get truncated in search results |

### Description Best Practices

| Practice                        | Example                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Summarize the page              | "Step-by-step guide to deploy using Docker containers" |
| Include relevant keywords       | Naturally, not stuffed                                 |
| Keep between 120–160 characters | Shorter gets cut off, longer gets truncated            |
| Make it actionable              | "Learn how to..." or "Set up..."                       |

## Site Name

The `name` field in `docs.json` is used in title tags and Open Graph metadata:

```json docs.json
{
  "name": "Acme Docs"
}
```

Search results typically show: **Page Title — Site Name**

## Social Sharing

When someone shares a link to your docs on Twitter, LinkedIn, Slack, or Discord, the Open Graph tags control what preview appears:

<Frame caption="Social share preview card">
  Screenshot needed: A social media share card showing the page title,
  description, and site name from the Open Graph tags, as it would appear when
  shared on Twitter or Slack.
</Frame>

The preview automatically uses:

- **Title**: From the page's `title` frontmatter
- **Description**: From the page's `description` frontmatter
- **Site name**: From `docs.json` `name` field

## Sitemap

Baseflow automatically generates a sitemap for your documentation site. Search engines use this to discover and index all your pages.

<Callout type="info">
  The sitemap is generated automatically based on your navigation config. Every
  page listed in `docs.json` is included.
</Callout>

## SEO Checklist

Use this checklist for every new page:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add title frontmatter">
    Every page needs a unique, descriptive `title` under 60 characters.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add description frontmatter">
    Write a concise `description` (120–160 characters) summarizing the page
    content.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use proper heading hierarchy">
    Start with one `# H1`, then use `##` and `###` for sections. Don't skip
    levels.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link between pages">
    Internal links help search engines understand your site structure. Link
    related pages to each other.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use descriptive link text">
    "See the [authentication guide](/guides/auth)" is better than "Click
    [here](/guides/auth)."
  </Step>
</Steps>
