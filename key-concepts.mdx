# Key Concepts

Before diving into the details, here's how the main pieces of Baseflow fit together.

## Projects

A **project** is a single documentation site. Each project has its own:

- **GitHub repository** (or a specific branch within one)
- **Navigation structure** defined in `docs.json`
- **Subdomain** at `your-slug.baseflow.dev` (or a custom domain)
- **Team members** with role-based access

You can run multiple projects from one Baseflow account — for example, public-facing API docs, an internal knowledge base, and a product changelog.

## Bi-Directional Git Sync

Baseflow keeps your GitHub repository and the visual editor in perfect sync:

- **Git → Baseflow**: Push a commit to your connected branch and the changes appear in the visual editor and on your live site within seconds.
- **Baseflow → Git**: Edit a page in the visual editor and Baseflow commits the change back to your repository automatically.

This means developers can keep using their preferred editor and Git workflow, while non-technical team members use the browser. Neither workflow blocks the other.

<Callout type="info">
  Every edit made in the visual editor creates a real Git commit, so you always
  have a full history of changes.
</Callout>

## MDX

Baseflow uses **MDX** — Markdown extended with JSX components. This means you write standard Markdown for text content and drop in rich components where you need them.

```mdx
# Welcome

Regular Markdown works as expected: **bold**, _italic_, [links](https://example.com).

But you can also use components:

<Callout type="tip">This is a tip rendered as a styled callout box.</Callout>

    Description here.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Second" icon="zap">
    Another card.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
```

You don't need to import components — they're available globally on every page.

## Visual Editor

The visual editor is a browser-based WYSIWYG interface for writing and editing documentation. It supports:

- Rich text formatting (headings, bold, italic, lists, links)
- Drag-and-drop page reordering in the sidebar
- Component insertion via a slash command or toolbar
- Real-time preview of exactly what the published page looks like

The editor is designed for team members who don't work in code. Everything they do results in valid MDX committed back to the repository.

## Instant Deploys

There's no build step. When Baseflow detects a change — whether from a Git push or a visual editor save — the updated page goes live immediately. No CI pipeline, no waiting for builds, no manual publish button.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Change detected">
    A commit lands on the connected branch, or a page is saved in the visual
    editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Content processed">
    Baseflow parses the MDX, resolves navigation, and stores the result.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Live in seconds">
    The updated page is available at your docs URL. No cache to bust, no deploy
    queue.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Docs Configuration

Every project is configured through a single `docs.json` file at the root of your repository. This file controls:

- **Site name and metadata**
- **Navigation structure** (groups, pages, nesting)
- **Logo and branding assets**
- **Color theme** overrides
- **Top navigation links** and social icons

See [docs.json reference](/project-structure/docs-json) for the full schema.
