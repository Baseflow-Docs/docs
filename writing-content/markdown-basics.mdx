# Markdown Basics

Baseflow supports standard Markdown (CommonMark) with a few additions. If you've written a GitHub README, you already know the fundamentals.

## Headings

Use `#` symbols to create headings. Baseflow uses headings to build the right-side table of contents automatically.

```markdown
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4
```

<Callout type="tip">
  Start each page with a single `# Heading 1`. Use `##` and `###` for sections
  and subsections. The table of contents displays `##` and `###` headings by
  default.
</Callout>

## Text Formatting

```markdown
**Bold text**
_Italic text_
**_Bold and italic_**
~~Strikethrough~~
`Inline code`
```

**Bold text**
_Italic text_
**_Bold and italic_**
~~Strikethrough~~
`Inline code`

## Links

```markdown
[External link](https://example.com)
[Internal link](/quickstart)
[Link with title](https://example.com "Hover text")
```

Internal links use paths relative to your docs root. Link to `/quickstart` rather than the full URL.

## Lists

### Unordered

```markdown
- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Third item
```

- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Third item

### Ordered

```markdown
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
```

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Blockquotes

```markdown
> This is a blockquote. Use it for longer quotes or to
> highlight a passage from another source.
```

> This is a blockquote. Use it for longer quotes or to highlight a passage from another source.

<Callout type="info">
  For styled callouts (tips, warnings, etc.), use the `Callout` component
  instead of blockquotes. See [Callouts](/components/callouts).
</Callout>

## Tables

```markdown

| Feature       | Free | Pro |
| ------------- | ---- | --- |
| Projects      | 3    | ∞   |
| Custom domain | —    | ✓   |
| Git sync      | —    | ✓   |

## Horizontal Rules

```markdown
---
```

Use `---` on its own line to insert a horizontal divider between sections.

## Images

```markdown
![Alt text](/path/to/image.png)
```

Place images in your repository and reference them by path. See [Images and Media](/writing-content/images-and-media) for details on asset handling.
