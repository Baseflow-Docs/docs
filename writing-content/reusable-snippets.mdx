# Reusable Snippets

When the same content appears on multiple pages — a disclaimer, a setup prerequisite, or a shared configuration block — you can extract it into a reusable snippet to keep things consistent and maintainable.

## How Snippets Work

A snippet is a regular MDX file stored in a designated folder (typically `snippets/` or `_snippets/`). You reference it from other pages, and Baseflow inlines the content at render time.

```
my-docs/
├── docs.json
├── quickstart.mdx
├── guides/
│   ├── setup.mdx
│   └── advanced.mdx
└── snippets/
    ├── prerequisites.mdx
    └── support-callout.mdx
```

## Creating a Snippet

Create an MDX file in your snippets folder. Snippets don't need frontmatter:

```mdx snippets/prerequisites.mdx
<Callout type="info">
  **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v18+ and
  npm installed before proceeding.
</Callout>
```

## Using a Snippet

Reference the snippet in any page by its file path. The content gets inlined wherever you place the reference.

```mdx guides/setup.mdx

# Setup Guide

<snippet file="snippets/prerequisites.mdx" />

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

Run the following command...
```

The prerequisites callout will appear inline at that position in the rendered page.

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Keep snippets focused">
    Each snippet should cover one concept or block. Small, single-purpose
    snippets are easier to maintain and reuse.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use a consistent folder">
    Store all snippets in one location (e.g., `snippets/`). This makes them easy
    to find and prevents duplication.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Don't add frontmatter">
    Snippets don't render as standalone pages. Skip the `title` and
    `description` frontmatter — they're only inserted into other pages.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name descriptively">
    `prerequisites.mdx` is clearer than `snippet-1.mdx`. Use names that describe
    the content, not the location.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
  Snippets are great for keeping a "single source of truth." When the content
  changes, you update one file and every page that references it gets the update
  automatically.
</Callout>
