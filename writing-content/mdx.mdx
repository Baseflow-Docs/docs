# MDX

MDX lets you use JSX components directly inside Markdown. This is how Baseflow supports rich, interactive documentation without leaving a familiar writing format.

## What Is MDX?

MDX is Markdown + JSX. You write regular Markdown for prose and drop in components for anything richer — cards, tabs, callouts, code groups, and more.

```mdx
# Regular Markdown heading

This is a paragraph. Standard Markdown syntax works everywhere.

<Callout type="tip">
  And this is a component — rendered as a styled callout box.
</Callout>
```

Components are available globally. You never need to add import statements.

## Component Syntax

Components use JSX syntax:

```mdx
<ComponentName prop="value" numericProp={3} booleanProp>
  Children go here (can be Markdown or other components).
</ComponentName>
```

**Key rules:**

- Component names are **PascalCase** (`CardGroup`, not `cardgroup`)
- String props use quotes: `title="Hello"`
- Numeric and boolean props use curly braces: `cols={2}`
- Boolean props without a value default to `true`: `<Step>` is the same as `<Step expandable={true}>`
- Self-closing syntax works for components with no children: `<Icon name="star" />`

## Nesting Components

Components can be nested inside each other:

```mdx
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="First Card" icon="star">
    This card contains a **bold** word and a [link](/quickstart).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Second Card" icon="zap">
    <Callout type="info">You can even put callouts inside cards.</Callout>
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
```

## Markdown Inside Components

Most components accept Markdown as children. Bold, italic, links, lists, and code spans all work inside component bodies:

```mdx
<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure to run `npm install` **before** starting the dev server.

- Step one
- Step two
  </Callout>
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure to run `npm install` **before** starting the dev server.

- Step one
- Step two
  </Callout>

## Expressions

Use curly braces to embed JavaScript expressions:

```mdx
<CardGroup cols={2 + 1}>
  {/* This is a JSX comment — it won't appear in the output */}
</CardGroup>
```

## Common Patterns

### Feature grid

```mdx
<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Fast" icon="zap">
    Deploys in seconds.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flexible" icon="sliders">
    Customize everything.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Collaborative" icon="users">
    Built for teams.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
```

### Step-by-step guide

```mdx
<Steps>
  <Step title="Install">Run `npm install` in your terminal.</Step>
  <Step title="Configure">Create a `docs.json` at the project root.</Step>
  <Step title="Write">Add your first `.mdx` file.</Step>
</Steps>
```

### Tabbed content

````mdx
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">```bash npm install baseflow ```</Tab>
  <Tab title="yarn">```bash yarn add baseflow ```</Tab>
</Tabs>
````

## What's Next

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Frontmatter"
    icon="file-text"
    href="/writing-content/frontmatter"
  >
    Add metadata to your pages with YAML frontmatter.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Components Overview" icon="puzzle" href="/components/overview">
    See every available component and how to use it.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
