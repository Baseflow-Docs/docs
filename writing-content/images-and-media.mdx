# Images and Media

Baseflow supports images in Markdown syntax and offers the `Frame` component for screenshots and media that need captions or borders.

## Basic Images

Use standard Markdown image syntax:

```markdown
![Dashboard overview](/images/dashboard.png)
```

Place image files in your repository and reference them by path. Baseflow resolves paths relative to the repository root.

## Image Paths

Images can live anywhere in your repo. A common convention is an `images/` or `assets/` folder:

```
my-docs/
├── docs.json
├── quickstart.mdx
└── images/
    ├── dashboard.png
    └── setup-wizard.png
```

Then reference them:

```markdown
![Setup wizard](/images/setup-wizard.png)
```

<Callout type="tip">
  Use descriptive file names like `github-app-install.png` instead of
  `screenshot-1.png`. This makes the repo easier to navigate and improves
  accessibility via alt text.
</Callout>

## The Frame Component

For screenshots and images that benefit from a caption or styled border, use the `Frame` component:

```mdx
<Frame caption="The project dashboard after first deploy">
  ![Project dashboard](/images/dashboard.png)
</Frame>
```

<Frame caption="The project dashboard after first deploy">
  Screenshot needed: A project dashboard showing the sidebar navigation, recent
  activity, and deploy status.
</Frame>

The `Frame` component adds:

- A subtle border around the image
- An optional caption below
- Consistent spacing and alignment

See [Frames](/components/frames) for the full component API.

## External Images

You can link to externally hosted images:

```markdown
![Logo](https://example.com/logo.png)
```

<Callout type="warning">
  External images depend on third-party availability. For critical documentation
  assets, host images in your repository to ensure they're always accessible.
</Callout>

## SVGs

SVG files work the same as other images:

```markdown
![Architecture diagram](/images/architecture.svg)
```

SVGs are particularly useful for diagrams and icons since they scale cleanly at any size.

## Best Practices

| Practice                    | Why                                           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Add meaningful alt text     | Improves accessibility and SEO                |
| Use `Frame` for screenshots | Provides consistent styling and captions      |
| Optimize file size          | Large images slow down page loads             |
| Use SVG for diagrams        | Scales without quality loss                   |
| Organize images in a folder | Keeps the repo clean and images easy to find  |
| Use descriptive file names  | Easier to manage and better for accessibility |
