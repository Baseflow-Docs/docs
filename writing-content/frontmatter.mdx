# Frontmatter

Frontmatter is a YAML block at the top of each MDX file. It sets the page title, description, and other metadata that Baseflow uses for rendering and SEO.

## Basic Frontmatter

Every page should include at least `title` and `description`:

```mdx
---
title: Getting Started
description: Learn how to set up your first Baseflow project.
---

# Getting Started

Your page content starts here.
```

## Available Fields

| Field          | Type     | Description                                                              |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `title`        | `string` | Page title. Displayed in the browser tab, sidebar, and navigation links. |
| `description`  | `string` | Short summary. Used in SEO meta tags and search results.                 |
| `icon`         | `string` | Icon name to display next to the page title in the sidebar.              |
| `sidebarTitle` | `string` | Override the title shown in the sidebar (useful for shorter labels).     |

## Title and Description

The `title` field is required. It's used:

- As the `<title>` tag in the rendered HTML
- As the default heading if the page body doesn't start with an `# H1`
- In the sidebar navigation
- In Open Graph / social sharing previews

The `description` field is strongly recommended for SEO:

```yaml
---
title: API Authentication
description: Learn how to authenticate requests to the API using bearer tokens.
---
```

## Sidebar Customization

If a title is too long for the sidebar, use `sidebarTitle` to set a shorter version:

```yaml
---
title: Configuring Single Sign-On with SAML 2.0
sidebarTitle: SAML SSO
---
```

## Icons

Add an icon next to the page title in the sidebar:

```yaml
---
title: Quickstart
icon: rocket
---
```

<Callout type="tip">
  Baseflow supports a wide range of icon names. Use short, descriptive names
  like `rocket`, `code`, `book`, `star`, `settings`, etc.
</Callout>

## Example

Here's a complete frontmatter block using all available fields:

```yaml
---
title: Deploying to Production
description: Step-by-step guide for deploying your documentation site to a custom domain.
sidebarTitle: Deploy
icon: globe
---
```
