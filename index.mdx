# Welcome to Baseflow

Baseflow is a documentation platform built for product teams. Developers write in Git using MDX, product managers and support teams use a clean visual editor, and everything stays in sync automatically.

## How Baseflow Works

Baseflow gives every team member a workflow that fits:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Write">
    Author docs in MDX from your code editor, or use the visual editor in the
    browser. Both workflows produce the same output.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sync">
    Changes flow in both directions automatically. Edit in the browser and it
    appears in Git. Push to Git and it shows in the editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Every update goes live instantly. No build pipeline. No manual publishing.
    From edit to live in seconds.
  </Step>
</Steps>
