# Visual Editor

The visual editor lets non-technical team members write, edit, and publish documentation directly in the browser. Every change made in the editor is synced back to your Git repository automatically.

## Overview

<Frame caption="The Baseflow visual editor">

  area in the center, formatting toolbar at the top, and sidebar navigation on
  the left.
</Frame>

The visual editor provides:

- **Rich text editing** — headings, bold, italic, lists, links, and more
- **Component insertion** — add cards, callouts, tabs, and other components via slash commands
- **Live preview** — see exactly how the page will look when published
- **Drag-and-drop** — reorder pages in the sidebar by dragging them
- **Instant publishing** — changes go live the moment you save

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the editor">
    Navigate to your project in the Baseflow dashboard and click **Edit** on any page, or click **Visual Editor** in the project navigation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit content">
    Click anywhere on the page to start typing. Use the toolbar for formatting or type `/` to insert a component.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and publish">
    Click **Save** to publish your changes. The updated page goes live instantly, and Baseflow commits the change to your Git repository.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Formatting

The toolbar provides quick access to common formatting options:

| Action        | Toolbar Button | Markdown Equivalent |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| Bold          | **B**          | `**text**`          |
| Italic        | _I_            | `_text_`            |
| Heading 2     | H2             | `## Heading`        |
| Heading 3     | H3             | `### Heading`       |
| Bullet list   | •              | `- item`            |
| Numbered list | 1.             | `1. item`           |
| Link          | 🔗             | `[text](url)`       |
| Code          | `<>`           | `` `code` ``        |

## Inserting Components

Type `/` on a new line to open the component menu. Select a component to insert it:

- **Callout** — tip, warning, info, or danger box
- **Card Group** — grid of cards
- **Tabs** — tabbed content
- **Code Block** — syntax-highlighted code
- **Steps** — numbered step-by-step guide
- **Accordion** — expandable section
- **Image** — upload or reference an image

## Page Management

### Creating pages

Click **New Page** in the sidebar to create a new documentation page. Choose where it should appear in the navigation.

### Reordering pages

Drag and drop pages in the sidebar to reorder them. The navigation in `docs.json` is updated automatically.

### Deleting pages

Right-click a page in the sidebar and select **Delete**. The file is removed from the Git repository.

<Callout type="warning">
  Deleting a page in the visual editor permanently removes it from your Git
  repository. This is like deleting a file and committing the change.
</Callout>

## Git Sync

Every action in the visual editor creates a real Git commit:

| Action             | Git Result                                      |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Edit page content  | Commit updating the MDX file                    |
| Create new page    | Commit adding a new MDX file + docs.json update |
| Delete page        | Commit removing the file + docs.json update     |
| Reorder navigation | Commit updating docs.json                       |

This means your Git history is always complete — even if every edit was made in the browser.

<Callout type="info">
  Developers working in Git and editors working in the browser never conflict.
  Both workflows produce the same MDX files, and Baseflow keeps everything in
  sync.
</Callout>
