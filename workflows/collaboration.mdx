# Collaboration

Baseflow is designed for teams where multiple people contribute to documentation — developers, product managers, support engineers, and technical writers. Here's how to set up collaborative workflows.

## Team Roles

Baseflow supports role-based access so each team member has the right level of control:

| Role   | Can View | Can Edit | Can Configure | Can Manage Members |
| ------ | -------- | -------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Viewer | ✓        | —        | —             | —                  |
| Editor | ✓        | ✓        | —             | —                  |
| Admin  | ✓        | ✓        | ✓             | ✓                  |
| Owner  | ✓        | ✓        | ✓             | ✓                  |

## Inviting Team Members

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open project settings">
    Go to your project in the dashboard and navigate to **Settings → Team**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Invite by email">
    Enter the email address of the team member you want to invite and select
    their role.
  </Step>
  <Step title="They accept the invite">
    The invited team member receives an email with a link to join the project.
    Once accepted, they can access the project based on their role.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Workflow by Role

Different team members use Baseflow differently. Here's which workflow fits each role:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Developers" icon="code">
    **Workflow:** Git

    Write MDX in their code editor, commit to branches, open pull requests. Review documentation changes alongside code changes.

  </Card>
  <Card title="Product Managers" icon="pen-tool">
    **Workflow:** Visual Editor

    Edit pages directly in the browser. Create and reorganize content without touching Git. Publish instantly or submit for review.

  </Card>
  <Card title="Support Engineers" icon="headphones">
    **Workflow:** Visual Editor

    Quickly update help articles, troubleshooting guides, and FAQ pages based on support ticket patterns. No engineering bottleneck.

</CardGroup>

## Working Together

### Avoiding conflicts

Baseflow handles concurrent editing gracefully:

- **Git + Git:** Standard Git merge rules apply. If two people edit different files, both changes merge cleanly. If they edit the same file, Git handles the merge (or flags a conflict).
- **Git + Visual Editor:** Changes sync in both directions. The visual editor always reflects the latest state of the Git repository.
- **Visual Editor + Visual Editor:** Saves are committed sequentially. The latest save wins for each page.

<Callout type="tip">
  For large teams, establish page ownership. When one person owns a page,
  conflicts are rare because only one person typically edits a page at a time.
</Callout>

### Communication patterns

| Pattern                      | How                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Request a content review     | Open a pull request with documentation changes |
| Assign page ownership        | Note in team docs or use GitHub CODEOWNERS     |
| Track documentation tasks    | Create GitHub issues labeled "docs"            |
| Notify team of major changes | Use PR descriptions and commit messages        |

## GitHub CODEOWNERS

For teams using the Git workflow, add a `CODEOWNERS` file to require reviews from specific people when documentation changes:

```text CODEOWNERS
# Require docs team review for all documentation changes
*.mdx @yourorg/docs-team
docs.json @yourorg/docs-team

# Require API team review for API documentation
api/ @yourorg/api-team
```

This ensures the right people review changes to their areas of ownership.
