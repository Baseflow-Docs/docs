# Git Workflow

Baseflow treats your documentation repository as the source of truth. Every page, image, and configuration file lives in Git, giving you the full power of version control for your docs.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Write locally">
    Edit MDX files in your preferred code editor — VS Code, Vim, JetBrains,
    whatever you use for code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Commit and push">
    Commit your changes and push to the connected branch (usually `main`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic sync">
    Baseflow detects the push and updates your live docs site within seconds. No
    build step, no deploy command.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Branch Strategy

### Single-branch workflow

The simplest approach: push directly to `main`. Every commit goes live immediately.

```
main ─────●─────●─────●───── (live)
```

Best for: small teams, personal projects, frequently updated docs.

### Branch + PR workflow

Use feature branches and pull requests to review changes before they go live:

```
main ─────────────●───────── (live)
                 ╱
feature ────●───●
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a branch">
    ```bash git checkout -b docs/add-auth-guide ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write and commit">
    Make your changes, commit them to the feature branch.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open a pull request">
    Create a PR on GitHub. Team members can review the content changes just like
    code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Merge to go live">
    Once approved, merge the PR into `main`. Baseflow picks up the changes and
    publishes them.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Reviewing Docs in PRs

Documentation changes show up in GitHub pull request diffs just like code changes. Reviewers can:

- See exactly what text was added, removed, or modified
- Leave inline comments on specific lines
- Request changes before the content goes live
- Approve the PR to allow merging

<Callout type="tip">
  Use descriptive commit messages like "Add authentication guide" instead of
  "Update docs." This makes the Git history useful for understanding what
  changed and why.
</Callout>

## Connecting a Repository

Set up the Git connection from the Baseflow dashboard:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the GitHub App">
    Go to **Project Settings → GitHub** and install the Baseflow GitHub App on
    your GitHub account or organization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select repository and branch">
    Choose the repository and branch that contains (or will contain) your
    documentation files.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic sync starts">
    Baseflow begins syncing immediately. Any existing docs in the repo will
    appear on your site.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## .gitignore

You don't need any special `.gitignore` rules for Baseflow. Your docs repo typically contains only:

- MDX files
- Images and logos
- `docs.json` config
- Optionally, snippets and other assets

All of these should be tracked in Git.
