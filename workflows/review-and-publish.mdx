# Review and Publish

Baseflow supports multiple publishing approaches — from instant live edits to gated review processes. Choose the workflow that fits your team's needs.

## Publishing Models

### Instant publish (default)

Changes go live the moment they're saved (visual editor) or pushed to the connected branch (Git). This is the default behavior and works well for teams that move fast.

**Best for:** Small teams, frequently updated docs, internal documentation.

### Branch-based review

Use Git branches and pull requests to review changes before they go live. Only content on the connected branch (e.g., `main`) is published.

**Best for:** Public-facing documentation, regulated industries, larger teams.

## Setting Up Reviews

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Git-Based Review">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Use feature branches">
        Developers create branches for documentation changes, just like code changes:

        ```bash
        git checkout -b docs/update-auth-guide
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Open a pull request">
        Push the branch and open a PR on GitHub. Assign reviewers from your team.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Review the changes">
        Reviewers see the MDX diff on GitHub. They can leave comments on specific lines, request changes, or approve.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Merge to publish">
        Once approved, merge the PR to your connected branch. Baseflow publishes the changes immediately.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Visual Editor Review">
    When team members use the visual editor, changes can follow one of two patterns:

    **Direct publish:** The editor saves directly to the connected branch. Changes go live immediately. Best for trusted editors making quick fixes.

    **Draft mode:** Authors can save changes as drafts that don't publish until reviewed. Drafts are visible in the dashboard for reviewers to approve.

## Review Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Review content, not just format">
    Check for accuracy, clarity, and completeness. Technical accuracy matters
    more than perfect grammar.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Set clear ownership">
    Assign documentation owners for each section. The owner is responsible for
    reviewing changes to their pages.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use descriptive PR titles">
    "Add OAuth 2.0 authentication guide" is better than "Update docs." Make the
    purpose of the change clear.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review promptly">
    Stale PRs block documentation updates. Set a team norm for review turnaround
    (e.g., 24 hours).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Rollbacks

Since every change is a Git commit, rolling back is straightforward:

```bash
# See recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# Revert a specific commit
git revert <commit-hash>

# Push the revert
git push
```

Baseflow picks up the revert commit and updates the live site immediately.

<Callout type="tip">
  Git revert creates a new commit that undoes the changes. This preserves
  history and is safer than reset or force-push.
</Callout>
