# AI Features

Baseflow integrates AI capabilities to help you write better documentation faster. From drafting new pages to answering reader questions, AI works alongside your team to improve the documentation experience.

<Callout type="info">
  AI features are available on the **AI plan** ($59/month) and above.
</Callout>

## AI Writing Assistant

The AI writing assistant helps authors create and improve documentation directly in the visual editor.

### Drafting new content

Start with a topic and let AI generate a first draft:

  user types "Write a guide for setting up webhooks" and the AI generates a
  structured draft below.
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the AI assistant">
    In the visual editor, click the **AI** button in the toolbar or use the
    keyboard shortcut.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe what you need">
    Enter a prompt like "Write a quickstart guide for the webhooks API" or
    "Explain how to authenticate with OAuth 2.0."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and edit">
    The AI generates a draft with proper MDX formatting — headings, code blocks,
    callouts, and more. Review the output and edit as needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Improving existing content

Select text on any page and use AI to:

- **Simplify** — rewrite technical content in plainer language
- **Expand** — add more detail to a brief section
- **Summarize** — condense a long section into key points
- **Fix** — correct grammar, spelling, and phrasing

  showing options: Simplify, Expand, Summarize, Fix Grammar.

### Generating components

Ask the AI to create structured content with components:

- "Create a 3-step guide for deploying to production"
- "Add a FAQ section with 5 common questions about pricing"
- "Generate a comparison table of our API plans"

The AI outputs valid MDX with the appropriate Baseflow components (`Steps`, `AccordionGroup`, tables, etc.).

## AI Search

AI-powered search lets readers ask natural-language questions and get direct answers from your documentation.

<Frame caption="AI search answering a reader's question">
  Screenshot needed: The docs search interface showing a user question "How do I
  connect my GitHub repo?" and an AI-generated answer with a link to the
  relevant page.
</Frame>

### How it works

1. A reader types a question in the search bar
2. AI searches across all your documentation pages
3. A direct answer is generated from relevant content
4. Source pages are linked for readers who want more detail

### Benefits over traditional search

| Feature              | Traditional Search     | AI Search                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Query type           | Keywords only          | Natural language questions   |
| Results              | List of matching pages | Direct answer + source links |
| Handles synonyms     | Limited                | Yes — understands intent     |
| Multi-page synthesis | No                     | Yes — combines information   |

## AI Content Suggestions

Baseflow analyzes your documentation and proactively suggests improvements:

- **Missing content** — topics referenced in your docs but not covered in their own page
- **Outdated sections** — areas that haven't been updated in a long time
- **Readability issues** — sections that may be too complex for the target audience
- **Broken references** — internal links that point to non-existent pages

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="AI drafts, humans edit">
    Use AI to generate first drafts quickly, but always review and edit the
    output. AI gets the structure right but needs human judgment for accuracy
    and tone.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be specific with prompts">
    "Write a guide for OAuth 2.0 authentication using bearer tokens with code
    examples in Node.js" produces better results than "Write about auth."
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review AI search answers">
    Periodically test AI search with common reader questions. Make sure the
    answers are accurate and link to the right pages.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Act on suggestions">
    Check the AI content suggestions weekly. Even if you don't implement every
    suggestion, they highlight where your docs need attention.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Callout type="tip">
  AI features work best when your documentation is well-structured. Good
  frontmatter (title + description), proper heading hierarchy, and clear writing
  all help the AI understand and surface your content effectively.
