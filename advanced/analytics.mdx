# Analytics

Baseflow provides built-in analytics to help you understand how readers interact with your documentation. Use these insights to improve content, identify gaps, and prioritize updates.

<Callout type="info">
  Analytics are available on the **Pro plan** and above.

## Dashboard Overview

The analytics dashboard shows key metrics for your documentation site:

## Key Metrics

### Page Views

Track which pages get the most traffic. High-traffic pages should be kept accurate and up to date — they have the most impact on your users.

| Metric          | What It Tells You                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Total views     | Overall documentation traffic                       |
| Views per page  | Which pages are most visited                        |
| Trend over time | Whether documentation usage is growing or declining |

### Popular Pages

See your most-visited pages ranked by view count. This helps you:

- Prioritize quality and accuracy on high-traffic pages
- Identify which topics matter most to your users
- Spot unexpected popular pages that might need more depth

### Search Queries

If your docs site includes search, analytics shows what readers are searching for:

- **Top searches** — the most common search terms
- **No-result searches** — terms that returned no matches (content gaps)
- **Search-to-page** — which searches lead to which pages

<Callout type="tip">
  The "no-result searches" report is one of the most valuable analytics
  features. It tells you exactly what content your readers need but can't find.
  Use it to plan new pages.
</Callout>

### User Engagement

Understand how deeply readers engage with your content:

| Metric              | Description                                                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Time on page        | Average reading time per page                              |
| Bounce rate         | Percentage of visitors who leave after one page            |
| Navigation patterns | How readers move between pages — common paths through docs |

## Using Analytics to Improve Docs

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check weekly">
    Review analytics weekly. Look for pages with declining traffic, high bounce
    rates, or new search terms.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill content gaps">
    When "no-result searches" reveals missing topics, create pages to address
    them.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Improve popular pages">
    Your top 10 pages represent the majority of reader experience. Keep them
    polished, accurate, and up to date.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prune unused content">
    Pages with consistently zero traffic may be outdated or unnecessary. Archive
    or remove them to keep the docs focused.
  </Step>
</Steps>
