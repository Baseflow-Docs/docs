# Versioning

As your product evolves, you may need to maintain documentation for multiple versions — keeping current docs up to date while preserving docs for older releases.

## Approach

Baseflow uses a **branch-based versioning** model. Each documentation version corresponds to a Git branch:

| Branch | Documentation Version |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| `main` | Latest (current)      |
| `v2`   | Version 2.x           |
| `v1`   | Version 1.x           |

When readers select a version, Baseflow serves the documentation from the corresponding branch.

## Setting Up Versions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create version branches">
    When you release a new major version, create a branch from your current docs:

    ```bash
    # Freeze current docs as v2
    git checkout main
    git checkout -b v2

    # Push the version branch
    git push origin v2
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure versions in the dashboard">
    Go to **Project Settings → Versions** and add each branch as a named version.

    <Frame caption="Version configuration">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Continue writing on main">
    New documentation goes on `main` (or your latest branch). The version branches are frozen snapshots of the docs at that point in time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Version Workflow

### Adding a new version

When you ship a major product release:

1. Create a new branch from `main` (e.g., `v3`)
2. Add it to the version configuration
3. Continue writing on `main` for the next version

### Updating an older version

If you need to fix documentation in an older version:

1. Check out the version branch: `git checkout v2`
2. Make the fix and commit
3. Push to the version branch

Baseflow updates the versioned docs automatically.

### Deprecating a version

When a product version reaches end-of-life, you can:

- Remove it from the version configuration (hides the selector option)
- Add a callout to the version's pages noting deprecation
- Keep the branch in Git for historical reference

```mdx
<Callout type="warning">
  This documentation is for **v1**, which is no longer supported. Please upgrade
  to [the latest version](/).
</Callout>
```

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Version at major releases">
    Create version branches for major releases (v1, v2, v3). Don't version every
    minor update — it creates too many branches to maintain.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Keep latest on main">
    Always use `main` for the latest docs. This keeps the default branch up to
    date and makes new contributions straightforward.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Minimize maintenance">
    Only fix critical errors in older versions. Focus your writing effort on the
    latest version.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Link between versions">
    When deprecating features, add callouts that link to the newer version's
    equivalent page.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Callout type="info">
  If your product doesn't have distinct versions (e.g., a SaaS product with a
  single live version), you probably don't need versioning. Just keep all docs
  on `main`.
</Callout>
