# Callouts

Callouts draw attention to important information. Use them for tips, warnings, prerequisites, or any content that shouldn't be missed.

## Types

Baseflow supports five callout types:

```mdx
<Callout type="info">
  This is an informational note with additional context.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  A helpful suggestion to improve the reader's workflow.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  Something to be careful about — potential issues ahead.
</Callout>

<Callout type="check">
  A success message confirming something worked correctly.
</Callout>

<Callout type="danger">
  A critical warning — this action is destructive or irreversible.
</Callout>
```

## Props

| Prop   | Type     | Default  | Description                                                    |
| ------ | -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type` | `string` | `"info"` | Callout style: `info`, `tip`, `warning`, `check`, or `danger`. |

## Shorthand Aliases

Each callout type has a dedicated component alias for convenience:

```mdx
<Note>Same as `Callout type="info"`.</Note>
<Tip>Same as `Callout type="tip"`.</Tip>
<Warning>Same as `Callout type="warning"`.</Warning>
<Check>Same as `Callout type="check"`.</Check>
<Danger>Same as `Callout type="danger"`.</Danger>
```

<Note>Same as `Callout type="info"`.</Note>
<Tip>Same as `Callout type="tip"`.</Tip>
<Warning>Same as `Callout type="warning"`.</Warning>
<Check>Same as `Callout type="check"`.</Check>
<Danger>Same as `Callout type="danger"`.</Danger>

## Rich Content

Callouts support full Markdown — bold, code, links, and lists:

```mdx
<Callout type="warning">
  **Breaking change in v2.0:** The `config` field has been renamed to `settings`.

## When to Use Each Type

| Type      | Use for                                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `info`    | Additional context, background information, notes           |
| `tip`     | Best practices, shortcuts, helpful suggestions              |
| `warning` | Potential pitfalls, deprecations, things to watch out for   |
| `check`   | Success confirmation, completed steps, positive outcomes    |
| `danger`  | Destructive actions, irreversible operations, critical bugs |

<Callout type="tip">
  Use callouts sparingly. If every paragraph has a callout, none of them stand
  out. Reserve them for information that genuinely needs special attention.
