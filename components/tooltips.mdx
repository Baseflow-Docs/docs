# Tooltips

Tooltips add hover-activated definitions or context to any word or phrase. Use them to explain terms, abbreviations, or jargon without interrupting the reading flow.

## Basic Usage

```mdx
Baseflow uses <Tooltip tip="Markdown extended with JSX components">MDX</Tooltip> for all documentation pages.
```

Baseflow uses <Tooltip tip="Markdown extended with JSX components">MDX</Tooltip> for all documentation pages.

The tooltip appears when the reader hovers over the underlined text.

## Props

| Prop  | Type     | Description                            |
| ----- | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `tip` | `string` | **Required.** The text shown on hover. |

The component's children (the text between the tags) become the trigger element.

## Examples

### Technical terms

```mdx
Your docs site uses <Tooltip tip="Secure Socket Layer — encrypts data between the browser and server">SSL</Tooltip> by default.
```

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use for genuine clarification">
    Tooltips work best for terms that some readers may not know but that don't
    warrant a full paragraph of explanation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Keep tooltip text short">
    One or two sentences max. If you need more, link to a dedicated page
    instead.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Don't overuse">
    Too many tooltips on a page make the text hard to read. Reserve them for
    uncommon terms.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Avoid on mobile-critical content">
    Hover doesn't work well on touch devices. Don't put essential information
    only in tooltips.
