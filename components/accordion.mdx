# Accordion

Accordions let you hide content behind a clickable header. Readers expand sections on demand, keeping pages clean while still providing detailed information.

## Basic Accordion

```mdx
<Accordion title="What file format does Baseflow use?">
  Baseflow uses **MDX** — Markdown extended with JSX components. Standard `.mdx`
  files with optional YAML frontmatter.
</Accordion>
```

## Accordion Group

Use `AccordionGroup` to display multiple accordions together, such as on an FAQ page:

```mdx

    at $29/month for unlimited projects and additional features.

    Yes. Custom domains are available on the Pro plan and above. Connect your
    domain from **Project Settings → Domains**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does Baseflow require a build step?">
    No. Changes go live instantly — no CI pipeline or build process required.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can non-technical team members edit docs?">
    Absolutely. The visual editor lets anyone write and publish docs in the
    browser without touching Git or code.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
```

<Accordion title="Configuration example">
  Here's a complete `docs.json` configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "My Docs",
  "navigation": [
    {
      "group": "Guides",
      "pages": ["quickstart", "configuration"]
    }
