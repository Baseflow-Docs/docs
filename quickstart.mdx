# Quickstart

Go from zero to a live documentation site in four steps. No build pipeline required.

## 1. Create Your Account

Head to [baseflow.dev](https://baseflow.dev) and sign up with GitHub. Your account comes with one free project on the Starter plan.

  welcome copy.

## 2. Create a Project

From the dashboard, click **New Project**. Give it a name and a slug — the slug determines your default URL at `your-slug.baseflow.dev`.

<Callout type="info">
  You can connect a custom domain later from **Project Settings → Domains**.
</Callout>

## 3. Connect Your GitHub Repository

Baseflow syncs documentation from a GitHub repo. Connect the repository that holds (or will hold) your docs.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the GitHub App">
    When prompted, install the **Baseflow GitHub App** on your GitHub account or
    organization. Grant access to the repositories you want to sync.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a Repository">
    Pick the repo from the list. If you're starting fresh, create a new repo
    first and come back.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a Branch">
    Select the branch Baseflow should read from. Most teams use `main` or
    `docs`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Add Your First Page

Create a `docs.json` file at the root of your repo to configure navigation, then add your first MDX page.

<CodeGroup>
```json docs.json
{
  "name": "My Docs",
  "navigation": [
    {
      "group": "Getting Started",
      "pages": ["quickstart"]
    }
  ]
}
```

```mdx quickstart.mdx

# Quickstart

Welcome to the docs! Start writing here.
```

</CodeGroup>

Push the commit to your connected branch. Baseflow picks up the changes automatically and your site goes live within seconds.
