# File Organization

How you structure files in your documentation repository affects maintainability, navigation, and collaboration. Here are the recommended patterns.

## Recommended Structure

```
my-docs/
├── docs.json                  # Site configuration
├── index.mdx                  # Home page
├── quickstart.mdx             # Top-level pages
├── key-concepts.mdx
├── guides/                    # Grouped by topic
│   ├── authentication.mdx
│   ├── deployment.mdx
│   └── troubleshooting.mdx
├── api/                       # API reference
│   ├── overview.mdx
│   └── endpoints/
│       ├── users.mdx
│       └── projects.mdx
├── images/                    # Visual assets
│   ├── dashboard.png
│   └── setup-wizard.png
├── logos/                     # Brand assets
│   ├── logo-light.svg
│   └── logo-dark.svg
└── snippets/                  # Reusable content
    └── prerequisites.mdx
```

## Guidelines

### Match navigation to folders

Your folder structure should mirror the navigation in `docs.json`. If there's a "Guides" group in the sidebar, there should be a `guides/` folder in the repo.

```json
{
  "navigation": [
    {
      "group": "Guides",
      "pages": ["guides/authentication", "guides/deployment"]
    }
  ]
}
```

This makes it easy to find files in the repository based on where they appear in the sidebar.

### Use descriptive file names

| Good                     | Bad               |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| `authentication.mdx`     | `auth.mdx`        |
| `getting-started.mdx`    | `gs.mdx`          |
| `api-rate-limits.mdx`    | `limits.mdx`      |
| `github-app-install.png` | `screenshot1.png` |

File names become URL slugs, so `authentication.mdx` renders at `/guides/authentication`. Keep them readable.

### Separate assets from content

Keep images, logos, and other media in dedicated folders:

```
images/     → Screenshots, diagrams, illustrations
logos/      → Light/dark logo variants, favicon
snippets/  → Reusable MDX content blocks
```

<Callout type="tip">
  Don't scatter images alongside MDX files. A central `images/` folder makes
  assets easy to find and manage.
</Callout>

### Flat over deep

Prefer shallow folder structures. One level of nesting is usually enough:

```
# Good — flat and scannable
guides/
├── authentication.mdx
├── deployment.mdx
└── troubleshooting.mdx

# Avoid — too nested
guides/
└── getting-started/
    └── first-steps/
        └── authentication/
            └── overview.mdx
```

### Keep files small

Each MDX file should cover one topic. If a page gets longer than ~500 lines, consider splitting it into multiple pages and linking between them.

## Special Files

| File         | Purpose                                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `docs.json`  | Site configuration (required at repo root)      |
| `index.mdx`  | Home page — rendered at the root URL            |
| `snippets/*` | Reusable content blocks (not rendered as pages) |
| `logos/*`    | Logo variants referenced in `docs.json`         |
| `images/*`   | Media assets referenced from MDX pages          |
