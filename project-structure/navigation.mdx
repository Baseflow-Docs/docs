# Navigation

The `navigation` array in `docs.json` defines the sidebar structure of your docs site. It controls what pages appear, in what order, and how they're grouped.

## Basic Structure

Navigation is an array of **groups**. Each group has a name and a list of pages:

```json
{
  "navigation": [
    {
      "group": "Getting Started",
      "pages": ["quickstart", "key-concepts"]
    },
    {
      "group": "Guides",
      "pages": ["guides/authentication", "guides/deployment"]
    }
  ]
}
```

<Frame caption="Sidebar navigation rendered from the config above">

  deployment pages.
</Frame>

## Page References

Pages are referenced by their file path relative to the repository root, without the `.mdx` extension:

| File Path                   | Navigation Reference      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `quickstart.mdx`            | `"quickstart"`            |
| `guides/authentication.mdx` | `"guides/authentication"` |
| `api/endpoints/users.mdx`   | `"api/endpoints/users"`   |

The page title displayed in the sidebar comes from the `title` field in the page's frontmatter. If a `sidebarTitle` is set, that's used instead.

## Nested Groups

Groups can be nested inside other groups to create multi-level navigation:

```json
{
  "navigation": [
    {
      "group": "API Reference",
      "pages": [
        "api/overview",
        {
          "group": "Endpoints",
          "pages": [
            "api/endpoints/users",
            "api/endpoints/projects",
            "api/endpoints/deployments"
          ]
        },
        {
          "group": "Authentication",
          "pages": ["api/auth/api-keys", "api/auth/oauth"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Nested groups render as collapsible sections in the sidebar. Readers can expand and collapse them to navigate complex documentation.

</Frame>

## Ordering

Pages appear in the sidebar in the exact order they're listed in the `navigation` array. Baseflow does not auto-sort — you have full control over the order.

<Callout type="tip">
  Put your most important pages first. Readers tend to start from the top of the
  sidebar, so lead with quickstarts and overviews.
</Callout>

## Page Types

The `pages` array accepts three formats:

### String (simple page)

```json
"quickstart"
```

References a file by path. The sidebar label comes from the file's frontmatter `title` (or `sidebarTitle`).

### Object with path and title

```json
{ "path": "quickstart", "title": "Get Started" }
```

Overrides the sidebar label without changing the page's frontmatter.

### Nested group

```json
{
  "group": "Sub-Section",
  "pages": ["page-a", "page-b"]
}
```

Creates a collapsible subsection within the current group.

## Complete Example

```json
{
  "navigation": [
    {
      "group": "Getting Started",
      "pages": ["quickstart", "key-concepts"]
    },
    {
      "group": "Writing Content",
      "pages": [
        "writing-content/markdown-basics",
        "writing-content/mdx",
        "writing-content/frontmatter",
        "writing-content/code-blocks",
        "writing-content/images-and-media",
        "writing-content/reusable-snippets"
      ]
    },
    {
      "group": "Components",
      "pages": [
        "components/overview",
        "components/cards",
        "components/tabs",
        {
          "group": "Advanced Components",
          "pages": [
            "components/accordion",
            "components/steps",
            "components/tooltips"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Keep groups focused">
    Each group should cover one topic area. If a group has more than 8–10 pages,
    consider splitting into sub-groups.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Lead with action">
    Start with "Getting Started" or "Quickstart." Don't bury the entry point in
    the middle of the sidebar.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use descriptive group names">
    "Writing Content" is better than "Content." "API Reference" is better than
    "API."
  </Card>
  <Card title="Limit nesting depth">
    Two levels of nesting (group → sub-group) is usually enough. Deeper nesting
    makes navigation harder to scan.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
